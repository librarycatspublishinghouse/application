      content="Our main goal is to promote the activities of writing and reading. By providing the opportunity to have their manuscripts published professionally we are motivating inexperienced, first-time, amateur writers to finally take the decisive step to write and have their manuscripts read by other people. We understand that writing a book is a complex and arduous process. By providing help, editing services, constructive feedback, and a platform from where to spread the writerâ€™s work, we hope to incentivise the beautiful art of writing. By inviting people to write we are also expanding the act of reading; in order to write you have to read. Good writers are normally excellent and passionate readers. These two acts complement each other in a way that increasing one should also lead to an increase in the other."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
