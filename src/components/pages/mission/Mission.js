              Our main goal is to promote the activities of writing and reading.  
            </p>
            <p>
              By providing the opportunity to have their manuscripts published professionally we are motivating inexperienced, first-time, amateur writers to finally take the decisive step to write and have their manuscripts read by other people.  
            </p>
            <p>
              We understand that writing a book is a complex and arduous process. By providing help, editing services, constructive feedback, and a platform from where to spread the writerâ€™s work, we hope to incentivise the beautiful art of writing. 
            </p>
            <p>
              By inviting people to write we are also expanding the act of reading; in order to write you have to read. Good writers are normally excellent and passionate readers. These two acts complement each other in a way that increasing one should also lead to an increase in the other.
