By providing the opportunity to have their manuscripts published professionally we are motivating inexperienced, first-time, amateur writers to finally take the decisive step to write and have their manuscripts read by other people. We understand that writing a book is a complex and arduous process. By providing help, editing services, constructive feedback, and a platform from where to spread the writerâ€™s work, we hope to incentivise the beautiful art of writing. By inviting people to write we are also expanding the act of reading; in order to write you have to read. Good writers are normally excellent and passionate readers. These two acts complement each other in a way that increasing one should also lead to an increase in the other."/><link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="/stwWebFrontend/site-logo-white-bg.jpeg"/><link rel="manifest" href="/stwWebFrontend/manifest.json"/><title>Library Cats</title><script defer="defer" src="/stwWebFrontend/static/js/main.5b09ad62.js"></script><link href="/stwWebFrontend/static/css/main.25d6d050.css" rel="stylesheet"></head><body><noscript>You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.</noscript><div id="root"></div></body></html>
